AC299R (independent study) can be taken by students in the CSE program as an alternative to the AC297R capstone requirement for Spring 2023. We have compiled a list of project topics in data science and computational science for you to choose from. These projects will be completed under the supervision of instructors as specified for each project."


# How will this work 
Students will work on these projects in teams. The instructor of each project will define the deliverables and the grading criteria. However, all projects will have some common themes such as:

1. Open-ended problems with no pre-defined solutions
2. Emphasis on clear presentation and storytelling
3. Adoption of good software engineering practices such as Github flows
4. Preservation of the project and ideas
5. Time and scope management


## How to take this course
To take this course, you will need to complete two tasks before registration: creating a team and selecting a project.
We have created a simple <a href="">Google Sheet</a> where you can view the interests of other students and connect with them to form a team.
