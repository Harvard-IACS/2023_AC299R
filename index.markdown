<div style="font-family:Karla; font-size:1.2rem; color:#707070;line-height:1.6;"> AC299R (independent study) can be taken by students that are in the CSE program as an alternative to a capstone (AC297R) requirement for the spring 2023. We have collected projects of topics in data science and computational science.

# How will this work 
Students will work on any of these projects as teams. The advisor/instructor of each project will define the deliverables and how they will be grading the course. 

## How to Take this Course
There are two tasks that you need to do prior to registration. Create a team and select a project. 

We have created a simple gsheet where you can see the interest of other students and connect to form a team.
