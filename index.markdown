We have collected projects of topics in data science and computational science for you to choose from. 
These projects will be done with the supervision of the instructors as indicated per project.

# How will this work 
Students will work on any of these projects as teams. The advisor/instructor of each project will define the deliverables and how they will be grading the course. 

## How to Take this Course
There are two tasks that you need to do prior to registration. Create a team and select a project. 

We have created a simple gsheet where you can see the interest of other students and connect to form a team.
